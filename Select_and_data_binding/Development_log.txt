DEVELOPMENT LOG — Select and data binding

I created a copy of the Template folder and edited js/main.js. I used d3.select("#chart-area") to append an SVG element of 400x400. 
Then I created a data array with values [25, 20, 15, 10, 5] and used selectAll("rect").data(data).enter().append("rect") to bind the data to rectangles.

Each rectangle has a width of 40 and height based on its bound data value. I used the formula y = 255 - d to make them bottom aligned. 
The x position is calculated with the index (i * 50) to space them horizontally.

AI usage: I used AI to help determine the RGB color values for the fill attribute. 
My initial attempt resulted in all rectangles appearing black because the color values were too low. 
AI suggested multiplying the data and index values to create visible color variation: rgb(${i*10}, ${d*10}, ${i*15}).
