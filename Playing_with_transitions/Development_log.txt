DEVELOPMENT LOG — Playing with transitions

I implemented smooth transitions for the dynamic bar chart. 
The visualization now animates when switching between revenue and profit data.

I added transitions to EXIT (bars disappear downward), UPDATE (bars move to new positions), and ENTER (bars grow from bottom). 
All use 750ms duration. I used a key function .data(data, d => d.month) to track bars correctly and prevent axis jumping.

The interval alternates between all months (revenue) and data.slice(1) (profit without January) to demonstrate the EXIT pattern.

AI Usage: AI helped fix the ENTER transition. My bars started at their final position, so the transition had no effect. 
AI explained they need to start at the bottom (height, 0) and animate upward.
