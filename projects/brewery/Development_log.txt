DEVELOPMENT LOG — Star Lion Brewery
I created a bar chart to display the brewery's revenue data from January to July. I loaded the data from revenues.json and converted revenue values to numbers.
I set up an SVG of 600x400 with margins { left: 100, right: 10, top: 100, bottom: 60 }. I separated the SVG and group to add a black background rectangle. 
I created a header group containing a brown/gold stripe and the brewery logo using svg.append("g") with translate.
For the axes, I used d3.scaleBand() for X (months) and d3.scaleLinear() for Y (revenue). I formatted the Y axis ticks to show currency with "$" + (d/1000) + "K". 
I added labels for both axes in white.
The bars are filled with yellow rgb(204,204,2) to match the brewery branding.
AI Usage: I used AI to help change the background to black and style the axes (using stroke: white for lines and fill: white for text), since CSS wasn't applying correctly due to Bootstrap conflicts.
