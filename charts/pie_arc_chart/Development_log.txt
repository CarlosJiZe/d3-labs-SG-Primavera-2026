DEVELOPMENT LOG — Pie/Donut Chart

I created an interactive donut chart showing fruit distribution by regions with dynamic data switching.

I implemented d3.arc() with outerRadius and innerRadius (innerRadius > 0 creates the donut hole). Created d3.pie() layout with .value() to extract count field and .sort(null) to maintain data order. 
Used d3.nest() to group data by fruit, creating the structure needed for radio button generation and data filtering.

The exercise included pre-built Update Pattern animations using arcTween interpolation for smooth transitions between datasets. 
Radio buttons were generated dynamically from nested data, with .on("change", update) event listeners triggering the transition animations when switching between fruits.

AI Usage: AI helped with data transformation (converting count to number with +d.count and normalizing fruit names to lowercase) because I had issues getting the data in the proper format for the pie layout.
