DEVELOPMENT LOG — Area Chart

I created an area chart showing price data over time (2007-2012).

I implemented d3.area() generator with three coordinates: x for date position, y0 for the base (set to 0), and y1 for the actual price values. 
Added the path element with "steelblue" fill and passed the data through the area generator.

The key difference from line charts is the filled area between the line and x-axis, which emphasizes magnitude and trends over time.
