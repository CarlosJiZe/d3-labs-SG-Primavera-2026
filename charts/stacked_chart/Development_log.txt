DEVELOPMENT LOG — Stacked Area Chart

I created a stacked area chart showing beer production by country over time (2002-2015).

I implemented d3.stack() to transform flat data into layered paths. Extracted keys by filtering out 'date' column, then configured the stack with stackOrderNone for order and offset. 
The area generator uses d.data.date for x, and d[0]/d[1] for y0/y1 - different from simple area charts because stack() transforms data into nested arrays where d[0] is layer base and d[1] is layer top.

Created groups for each country using selectAll/data/enter pattern, appended paths with area generator, and added a legend with color squares and text labels.

AI Usage: AI helped reverse the legend order using keys.slice().reverse() because my initial implementation displayed countries backwards.
