DEVELOPMENT LOG — Simulating Update Event

I implemented a dynamic bar chart that alternates between revenue and profit data using the D3 Update Pattern. 
The visualization switches datasets every second with d3.interval().

I implemented the complete Update Pattern: JOIN → EXIT → UPDATE → ENTER. 
A boolean flag toggles between datasets and updates the Y-axis label accordingly.

The scales and axes update their domains on each update() call to adapt to current data values. 
I maintained the brewery's visual identity with black background, brown/gold header, logo, and yellow bars.

AI Usage: AI helped me fix axis styling. My classes were "x-axis" and "y-axis" but my CSS selector looked for ".axis", causing a mismatch. 
AI suggested using "x axis" and "y axis" as class names so the selector would work.
